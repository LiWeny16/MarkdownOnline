This project originated from a joke with my roommate three years ago, triggered when Typora started charging fees.

I said, "What's so hard about this project? Let's do it." He replied, "Go ahead and try; I bet you can't make anything worthwhile!" (Just joking)

Since then, I've been continuously improving and refining it, migrating from native JS to React, from JS to a pure TS project, and finally incorporating VSCode's front-end editor—gradually implementing my ideas and creativity.

Moreover, since it's really hard to find a decent, free, online Markdown editor on the web, I decided to make one!

## What is Markdown?

Unlike Word, Markdown is a text markup language that displays all operations in text form. 

For example, if you want to write a heading, in Word you might click on the heading option, but in Markdown, you indicate a heading by writing "#" before the text.  
Example:



```md
# I am a heading
```

 If you want to write a code block, it's relatively difficult in Word, but in Markdown, you just need to wrap your code with triple backticks.

````js
```js
    alert("welcome to markdown")
```
````

## Why use Markdown?

- Fast and convenient, suitable for writing blogs
- Word formatting can easily become messy; - Markdown sacrifices some complex functions in exchange for convenience
- Inputting code is easy and supports syntax highlighting
- Supports embedding LaTeX (Word actually can too)
- Based on HTML syntax, do what you think, achieve what you want
- ~~Of course, it's also the favorite of those who love aestheticsヾ(•ω•`)o~~
## Todo

- ~~Add PDF export~~
- ~~Add code highlighting~~
- ~~LaTeX formula support~~
- ~~Add keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+B for bold and Ctrl+Alt+C for center alignment~~
- ~~Image support~~
- ~~Replace with VSCode front-end editor, add full keyboard shortcut hint support~~
- Support running JS/Python scripts line by line like [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) (based on [WASM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly))
- ~~Add settings button to configure script injection and line break rules, etc.~~
- ~~[TOC] support~~

## Tutorial
